        <p className="history">
          During the time I lived in Petrolina-PE (2000-2012), I worked as a
          Music and Singing Instructor in schools and government programs. I did
          backing and played tenor sax in musical groups. I had a group that
          performed at weddings, called Tr√≠ade (We were in three voices). Oh!
          And also as a tenor sax musician in the Petrolina Philharmonic
          Orchestra. I currently live with my family in Curitiba-PR since 2012.
          Since then, I have tried to rediscover myself in other areas. I worked
          in commerce (bakery, selling cakes and cookies on my own). I also
          worked in the administrative area as a manager of a company in which I
          was a partner. Still, even with these opportunities, I didn't feel
          professionally out of place. But last year (2021), in the middle of a
          pandemic, I finally found myself!! I saw an advertisement about
          programming, I fell in love with the area!!! I decided to invest in
          training in this field, and "I'm loving it!!" Since May 2021, I am a
          student of the Certified Tech Developer course, at Edtech Digital
          House, and also doing Systems Analysis and Development at Cruzeiro do
          Sul University (Positivo), which will both last two years. Here, you
          can find and get to know my projects. Hope you enjoy the visit and
